# Double Viewer

This project is an interactive demo that shows you how a computer stores a _floating point_ number.
I've been meaning to create this demo ever since I learned about this in college.

Try it yourself [here](https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/double-viewer/).
Or watch me demonstrate [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DOYZhHjEVk).

I'm focused on a _double_.
This is a very common format for floating point numbers and has been for at least 30 years.
You can read a description of the [IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format).
Or you can probably figure it out by exploring this demo.
